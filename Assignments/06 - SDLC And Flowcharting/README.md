Task(s)
-------

You have been asked to create a computer program based on the following:

> A local gaming company is looking for a program that will complete the following tasks:
>  * Read a file that contains instructions:
>    * a maximum length of a filename
>    * a list of allowable file extensions (e.g. .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.)
>    * a list of unallowable characters for filenames (e.g. spaces, underscores, etc.)
>  * Compares all the files found in a folder to see if they match the criteria in the previous point
>  * Visually display the files that do **not** match the criteria, so that the programmer can go and fix these issues.
>
> **Note:** This will eventually become an assignment (with modifications), so ensure you complete this task to the best of your abilities.  It will help with the assignment later.

Using your knowledge of flowcharting and the SDLC complete the following tasks:
* Create a flowchart of how this system would work 
* Create a **basic** sample design of how the system would look (Visual depiction of a few screens (3-5 of the system).  
 
Do **not** use the [example program - to follow]() that was given

For creating flowcharts, there are some tools available online such as:
* [Create.ly](http://creately.com/) - you will have to sign up for an account to save work


Due Date(s)
-----------
Hand in your flowchart and designs to the IN drive by 3pm on March 3rd, 2017.

Rubric(s)
---------
Example of how to read the rubric below:
* The overall sections (_B2_, and _B4_) will be used to generate a mark
* The subsections (e.g. _B2.2_, _B2.4_, etc.) will be used to assess your understanding of the overall sections.
  * For example, _B2.2_, _B2.4_, and _B2.5_ will be used to generate a level for section _B2_. and so on through the various sections.

| | R | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|**B2: design software solutions to meet a variety of challenges** | | | | | |
|B2.2: use appropriate vocabulary and mode of expression to describe alternative program designs, and to explain the structure of a program | | | | | |
|B2.4: represent the structure and components of a program using industry-standard programming tools _(e.g. flow chart)_ | | | | | |
|B2.5:  design user-friendly software interfaces _(e.g. messages, screens, forms)_. | | | | | |
|**B4: apply a software development life-cycle model to a software development project** | | | | | |
|B4.1 describe the phases _(i.e., problem definition, analysis, design, writing code, testing, evolution)_, milestones _(e.g., date of completion of program specification)_, and products _(e.g., specification, flow chart, program, documentation, bug reports)_ of a software development life cycle | | | | | |
|B4.2: use a variety of techniques _(e.g., dialogue, questionnaires, surveys, research)_ to clarify program specifications; | | | | | |
