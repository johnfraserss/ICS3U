The purpose of this project is to further understand the relevance and the immediacy of this course by connecting what you are learning in class with real-world events or situations.

Task(s)
-------
1. Choose an emerging technology and its related field of study that is not Computer Science (i.e. if _animation_ were an emerging technology, then the related field of study would be art).
2. Create a report of any style, using any method of delivery (excluding a word processing document), that focuses on the societal, economic, and environmental impacts of the technology, and how the related field of study is collaborating with the Computer Science field.

#### Emerging Technology Topics
[Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emerging_technologies) is a recommended place to start looking for ideas.  All topics must be approved by the teacher.

#### Report Criteria
If you are creating a __written__ piece, you are to follow these criteria:
* No longer than 800 words.
* Include a descriptive title for your article

If you are creating an __audio__ piece, you are to follow these criteria:
* No longer than 10 minutes.

If you are creating a __video__ piece, you are to follow these criteria:
