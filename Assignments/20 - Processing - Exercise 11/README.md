Task(s)
-------
1. Make a copy of Assignment 2
2. In your new copy, modify the way our screen-with-circles works.  Create an array of PVectors, initializing each position inside the ```setup()``` function for the positions of the circles.  In your ```drawCircles()``` (or similarly named function), use a single ```for()``` loop to draw the circles (rather than 2 loops). 


Submissables
