Task(s)
-------
1. Make a copy of Assignment 2
2. In your new copy, modify the way the screen works that is using the nested ```for``` loops.  Create an array of PVectors, initializing each position inside the ```setup()``` function for the positions of your two-dimensional visualization.  In your ```drawItems()``` (or similarly named function), use a single ```for()``` loop to draw the circles (rather than 2 loops).

Submissables
