Task(s)
-------
You are to complete this task on your own (i.e. no group submissions, or no plagiarizing from each other (or internet), etc.)

1.  Using your knowledge of programming and if statements _create an assignment that satisfies the rubric and criteria below_.
2.  Create a flowchart of your program.

You can use this old assignment as inspiration, but do not create an exact duplicate of the assignment.  The old assignment can be found in the ```OUT\Seidel\ICS3U\Processing\Assignment 1``` folder.  Students were **only** allows to use arcs for the moving shapes at the time, and were **not** allowed to use ```translate()```, ```rotate()```, ```pushMatrix()```, or ```popMatrix()```.


Criteria
--------
Your program **does not** have:
  1. Flashing colours in it
  2. Similarity to exercises, or the given exemplar assignment.

Your program **does** have:
  1. A problem to solve. For example, you can have your program display and solve a mathematical problem (i.e. calculate the hypotenuse, calculate the area or circumference of a shape on the screen).
  2. Properly named variables 
  3. Colours that changes slowly depending on user controlled (or not controlled) factors
  4. Uses if statements other than in ```mousePressed()``` or ```keyPressed()```
  5. Your program fits to a maximum ```size(600, 600)```
  6. Has user input and displays output based on that input (i.e. use of ```mousePressed()``` or ```keyPressed()```.



Submissables
------------
Hand in a copy of your work to the IN drive; however, be prepared to have your work marked at your seat.


Due Date(s)
----------
Marking will begin at the beginning of class on April 10th.
