The purpose of this presentation is to further understand the relevance and the immediacy of this course by connecting what you are learning in class with real-world events or situations.

Task(s)
-------

In a group of 2-4, choose one new technology related to computer science that interests you all. Every group will choose a different topic.

Your group will develop and execute a presentation to educate your classmates about your topic. The presentation should be between 5 and 15 minutes.

Your group is to answer the following questions in your presentation.

1. What is the technology?
2. How is the technology currently being used?
3. How else can the technology be used besides its intended purpose(s)?
4. What are some of the technology's positive impacts to society?
5. What are some of the technology's negative impacts to society?
6. What are some of the programming concepts used in the technology?
7. What do you find most interesting about the technology?
8. What is the outlook of the technology?

All sources used must be cited in APA or MLA format.

Use the rubric to guide the development of your presentation.
