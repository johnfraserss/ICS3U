Task(s)
-------
You are to complete this task on your own (i.e. no group submissions, or no plagiarizing from each other (or internet), etc.)
1. Using your knowledge of programming, if statements, functions, and loops _create an assignment that satisfies the rubric and criteria below_.
2. Create a flowchart of your program.



Criteria
--------
Your program **does not** have:
  1. Flashing colours in it
  2. Similarity to exercises, or the given exemplar assignment.

Your program **does** have:
  1. A different problem to solve than Assignment 1.  Since this will be a multi-screen program, you can solve different problems on each screen.
  2. A multi-screen program (can click between them, or use the keyboard to swap between them)
  3. One one screen, show your understanding of ```while()``` loops
  4. On another screen, show your understanding of ```for()``` loops.
  5. If you create more than 2 screens, you should be using them to demonstrate other learned concepts.
  6. On at least one screen, show your understanding of **nested** loops (one inside the other).
  7. Your program fits to a maximum ```size(600, 600)```
  8. Has user input and displays output based on that input (i.e. use of ```mousePressed()``` or ```keyPressed()```.


Submissables
------------
Hand in a copy of your work to the IN drive; however, be prepared to have your work marked at your seat.


Due Date(s)
----------
Marking will begin at the beginning of class on May 1st
