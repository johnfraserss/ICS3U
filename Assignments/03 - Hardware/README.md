Test
------------
Test on Tuesday, February 14th, 2017 on the material presented + 1 thinking question.

The thinking question is not related to the materials presented; however, it is there to test your ability to break down a problem and think it through.

For example, last semester the question was _How many cows are there in Canada?_.  You did not have access to computers, internet, etc.  A correct answer would be along the lines of "How would I solve this?" or "How would I break down this question into factors I _can_ find?".
