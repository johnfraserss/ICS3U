Task(s)
-------
1. Create a sketch that reads information from a file, and displays ellipses (or rectangles) at the given coordinates and dimensions.  
   * The file you read in from will be formatted like below, and will contain information to help you create a screen full of randomly generated ellipses (or rectangles, your choice):

```text
600,600
200,50,400,200,500
153,323
22,32
434,345
10,200
...
```

1. The first line contains the dimensions of the screen.  
2. The second line will contain the values _N_, _w\_min_, _w\_max_,_h\_min_,_h\_max_ where:
   * _N_ is the number of coordinates that will follow
   * _w\_min_ is the minimum random value for the width
   * _w\_max_ is the maximum random value for the width
   * _h\_min_ is the minimum random value for the height
   * _h\_max_ is the maximum random value for the height

3. To create your own .txt file, run the program found in S:\OUT\SEIDEL\ICS3U\Exercise_10
