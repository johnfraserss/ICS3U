Task(s)
-------
You **may** complete this task in pairs, or on your own.

* Using your knowledge of programming, PVectors, functions, if statements, loops, arrays (or ArrayLists), and objects you will complete the following:

* Create a simulation of a real-life event, or real-world phenomenon (excluding any that we have done (or is similar to) in class previously - i.e. you can't do **just** gravity, etc.).  Your simulation must have the following:
  * Uses classes and objects (correctly)
  * Uses PVectors (correctly), preferably within your classes/objects
  * Must be more than 1-dimensional (i.e. can't just have a ball bouncing that slowly bounces less and less)
  * When you click on the screen, something occurs to the objects on the screen
  * Must apply a formula based on the dynamic information produced when you click on the screen, or based on the motion of an object.  This information needs to be displayed to the screen, and must have its own function to calculate
  * Must have something moving (or trying to) on the screen, based on an as-accurate-as-you-can model (if excluding factors such as friction or wind resistance, note that in a comment in your program)
  * Must include a visual representation of the PVectors (direction, length, etc.) as something moves above the screen (or tries to).

* A maximum mark of level 3 is available if you complete up to and including the formula portion
* A maximum mark of level 4 is available if you accurately include all requirements above with accuracy and purpose

This is just a sample of a rubric for the above

| | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|A1.5: Use one-dimensional arrays (or ArrayLists) properly within a program  | | | | | |
|A1.6: Declare, initialize, modify, and access one-dimensional arrays (or ArrayLists)  | | | | | |
|B2.3: Create a modular program (i.e. broken into classes)  | | | | | |
|A3.2: Write subprograms (i.e. functions) that use parameter passing (if necessary) and appropriate variable scope to perform tasks  | | | | | |
|A4.2: Use workplace conventions (naming, commenting, indenting, etc.)  | | | | | |
|B1.2: Demonstrate ability to solve the problem independently (or in pairs) | | | | | |
