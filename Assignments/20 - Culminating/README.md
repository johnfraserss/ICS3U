**The culminating is worth 20% of your final mark.  The remaining 10% will be the exam.**

Task(s)
-------
1. Using the knowledge you've acquired from the course, create a screensaver-like program.
2. Gallery walk
3. Complete a 1-page reflection of the process.

Software Criteria
--------
1. Use ```size(displayWidth, displayHeight)``` as your sizing for the window (can use smaller for testing)
2. The program will run in full screen mode (use Ctrl+Shift+R during testing).
3. Your program must be able to run on it's own when you hit the play button.
4. Your program must have an interactivity part with the mouse or keyboard (**must** also work **without** user input)
5. Your program must include the following concepts:
  * If statements
  * Looping
  * Functions
  * Objects
  * PVectors
6. Your program **cannot** be similar to any previous assignments.

If you are looking to expand your knowledge of PVectors and using them in creative ways, you can find more information [here](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-1-vectors/) and [here](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-2-forces/)

Gallery Walk
------------
How will the gallery walk work?
* At the begining of class on January 21st, 2016 you are going to log in and run your program.  
* The program should run on its own.
* If you have interactivity in your program you will be responsible to:
  * Print out a sheet with instructions for interactivity
  * Leave that sheet by your computer as your program runs

Reflection Criteria
---------
Using a word processor, write a maximum of 1-page (11-12 sized font), include answers to **at least** the following questions:

1. What would you do differently if you had to do this assignment over again?
2. What would you do to your program if you had another month to work on it?
3. What difficulties and challenges did you encounter?
4. During your gallery walk, were you impressed by any of the screensavers (other than your own)? If so, which one and why?  If not, choose one of them that you saw and describe how you would change it if you were the programmer.

Submissables
------------
Hand in your program and reflection to the IN drive.

Due Date(s)
----------
* Program due January 19th, 2016 by 2:46pm
* A gallery walk will be completed at the beginning of class on January 20th, 2016 to show off everyone's screensaver.
* Reflection due by January 20th, 2016 by 2:46pm
