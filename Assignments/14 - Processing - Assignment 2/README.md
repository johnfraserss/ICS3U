Task(s)
-------
You are to complete this task on your own (i.e. no group submissions, or no plagiarizing from each other (or internet), etc.)
* Using your knowledge of programming, if statements, functions, and loops you will complete either *Option A* or *Option B* below:

###Option A
Recreate the sketch found in the OUT\SEIDEL\ICS3U\Assign2 folder
* A maximum mark of level 3 is available if you do not include the text.
* A maximum mark of level 4 is available if you include the text on both screens, and the text on the lines screen must *not* exit the screen, nor overlap any lines.

###Option B
Create your own sketch that generates a piece of art based on the following criteria:
* Be something that generates a piece of art on the screen on start-up
* On mouse-click, the program either changes the piece of art to another one generated by your algorithm, *or*, changes to a different piece of art.
* A maximum mark of level 3 can be obtained if you complete the above
* A maximum mark of level 4 can be obtained in this project, if you create a comment at the bottom of your program that explains your piece of art, what meaning is behind it, and what emotions you are trying to invoke in the user of your program.
