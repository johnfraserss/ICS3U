Task(s)
-------
You may work **solo** or **in pairs** for this Assignment.

1. Using your knowledge of programming, including arrays (if necessary), Strings, input, and any concept prior to _create an assignment that satisfies the rubric and criteria below_.
2. Update and refine your flowchart that was given in the _SDLC and Flowcharting_ assignment.  If working in pairs, you must update your flowcharts individually.

Criteria
----------
Reminder:

> A local gaming company is looking for a program that will complete the following tasks:
* Read a file that contains instructions:
  * a maximum length of a filename
  * a list of allowable file extensions (e.g. .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.)
  * a list of unallowable characters for filenames (e.g. spaces, underscores, etc.)
* Compares all the files found in a folder to see if they match the criteria in the previous point
* Visually display the files that do not match the criteria, so that the programmer can go and fix these issues.
>

1. Create an instructions file by running the program found in S:\OUT\SEIDEL\ICS3U\Assignment_3
2. Create a Processing program that:
  * Reads the instructions file given for the _rules_ to follow.
  * Reads the file that contains folder/file information.
  * Compare the file information against the _rules_ given.
  * Visually display the files that do not match the criteria.
3. All _rules_ will be based on 5 instructions:
  * There will be a maximum length of a filename.  For example, "8.3" would state the maximum length of the file name is 8, plus a 3 character extension (i.e. "hello.jpg" would be okay, but "hello.jpeg" would not be okay.)
  * There will be a list of allowable file extensions. For example, "PNG JPG GIF" would list 3 options
  * There will be a list of unallowable characters. For example, "A0-\_" would list 4 options
  * There will be a list of allowable start-of-file names.  For example, "IM5" would match "IM5_2010.jpg" as a proper file.
  * There will be a maximum file size.  For example, "1000000" would mark any file above 1000000 to be fixed.
  * The values for each of the above will be randomized per person/group
4. Your "folder" will be another file with a listing of files.  It is up to you to figure out how to parse through the data.
